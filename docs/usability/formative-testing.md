# Formative Usability Testing Plan for GenPRES

## 1. Objective

The goal of this formative usability test is to evaluate the usability of GenPRES during early development stages, identify design issues, and improve the user interface for safe and efficient clinical use in pediatric and neonatal intensive care settings.

## 2. Scope

This test will focus on evaluating the core workflows and user interactions identified in the critical tasks document, including medication prescribing, TPN formulation, and response to alerts.

## 3. Test Participants

- **Participant Profile**: Pediatric ICU physicians, clinical pharmacists, and nurses  
- **Experience Level**: Varying levels of experience with EPD systems  
- **Sample Size**: 5–8 participants  

## 4. Methodology

- **Type**: Moderated in-person sessions with screen and voice recording  
- **Setting**: Simulated clinical environment with realistic patient scenarios  
- **Tools**: Usability testing software (e.g., Morae, Zoom), observation checklists  

## 5. Tasks Evaluated

1. Access the application from an EPD system  
2. Prescribe medication using patient-specific data  
3. Respond to safety alerts  
4. Modify an active prescription  
5. Calculate and export a TPN order  
6. Handle network disruption and resume session  

## 6. Data Collection

- Time to complete each task  
- Number and types of errors  
- Need for assistance or clarification  
- User comments and satisfaction ratings  
- Observational notes by the moderator  

## 7. Success Criteria

- Tasks completed without error or assistance by ≥80% of participants  
- Users express confidence in the system’s safety and clarity  
- Identified usability issues are actionable and prioritized for design revision  

## 8. Reporting and Analysis

A report will summarize quantitative data (completion rates, times) and qualitative insights (comments, frustrations). Recommendations will be made for design refinements and input to the next development sprint.
