# Summative Usability Testing Plan for GenPRES

## 1. Objective

The purpose of this summative usability test is to validate that GenPRES can be used safely and effectively by its intended users in its final implementation. This evaluation supports regulatory compliance (e.g., IEC 62366-1) and provides evidence of user interface adequacy for clinical deployment.

## 2. Scope

This evaluation includes all critical user workflows for GenPRES related to medication prescription, TPN formulation, and clinical decision support alerts. The full, production-ready system will be tested.

## 3. Participants

- **Intended Users**: Pediatric ICU physicians, clinical pharmacists, and nurses  
- **Experience Levels**: Representative range from novice to experienced  
- **Sample Size**: Minimum of 10 participants (per IEC 62366 recommendations)  

## 4. Methodology

- **Type**: Moderated sessions (in-person or remote), with real-time observation  
- **Environment**: Simulated clinical setting using realistic patient data  
- **Recording**: Screen recording, audio capture, written observer notes  

## 5. Test Scenarios

Each participant will perform a series of realistic clinical tasks:

1. Launch GenPRES via a URL with patient context  
2. Prescribe medication based on specific patient data  
3. Adjust a current prescription  
4. Calculate and review a TPN order  
5. Respond to a drug interaction alert  
6. Safely log out and resume session post-interruption  

## 6. Performance Metrics

- Task success rate (pass/fail)  
- Task completion time  
- Number and severity of use errors  
- User satisfaction rating (e.g., SUS score)  
- Observations of hesitation, confusion, or reliance on assistance  

## 7. Acceptance Criteria

- â‰¥90% of participants complete each critical task successfully  
- No use errors resulting in potential patient harm  
- Clear evidence of intuitive navigation and decision support  

## 8. Data Handling and Reporting

A formal report will summarize all test results, including:

- Quantitative results for each task  
- Qualitative feedback from participants  
- Root cause analysis of any critical errors  
- Recommendations for final UI adjustments or training materials
