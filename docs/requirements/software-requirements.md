# Software Requirements

Software Requirements Specification for GenPRES

1. System Overview

GenPRES is a clinical decision support system for prescribing and managing medication, including nutrition and TPN, within hospital environments such as pediatric and neonatal intensive care units. It is a web-based, stateless application designed for integration with any Electronic Patient Record (EPR/EPD) system via URL parameters.

2. Platform Requirements
	•	The application is built using the latest version of .NET (e.g., .NET 8 or higher).
	•	Can be deployed as a Docker container for cloud-native or local deployments.
	•	Alternatively, can be hosted on Microsoft IIS for traditional Windows-based server environments.
	•	Operates in a stateless configuration, ensuring scalability and independent operation.

3. User Interface Requirements
	•	The user interface is fully web-based and built using Material UI.
	•	Compatible with all modern web browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).
	•	Fully responsive design to support usage on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.
	•	Accessible via URL parameters to support EPD integration (e.g., https://genpres.app/start?patientId=123&sessionId=abc).

4. Integration and Interoperability
	•	Designed to be invoked via URL from any EPD system.
	•	Does not maintain internal session state—each session must include required parameters (e.g., patient ID, context).
	•	Will support integration with a local AI-powered language model (LLM) for enhanced decision support.
	•	Future versions will include integration with a clinical database for storing structured patient, treatment, and usage data.

5. Functional Requirements
	•	Provide support for prescribing oral, parenteral, and TPN medications.
	•	Validate medication dosages based on patient parameters (weight, age, renal function).
	•	Alert users of drug interactions and protocol violations.
	•	Enable TPN calculation and order export.
	•	Support multilingual UI and error messages.

6. Security Requirements
	•	Use secure HTTPS for all communications.
	•	Support for authentication and authorization via token-based or EPD-integrated mechanisms.
	•	Logging of all actions for auditability (support for external log management).

7. Deployment & Scalability
	•	Stateless design supports horizontal scaling in containerized environments.
	•	Configurable environment variables for multi-tenant or hospital-specific deployments.
	•	Runs independently of any particular infrastructure provider.

8. Future Enhancements
	•	Integration with clinical databases for longitudinal tracking.
	•	Expanded AI capabilities including anomaly detection and dosage suggestions.
	•	FHIR and HL7 integration for clinical interoperability.
