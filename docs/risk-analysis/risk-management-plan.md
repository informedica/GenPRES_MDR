# Risk Management Plan

Risk Management Plan for GenPRES

1. Introduction

This Risk Management Plan outlines the processes and responsibilities for identifying, evaluating, controlling, and monitoring risks associated with the development, deployment, and maintenance of GenPRES—a clinical decision support software system used for prescribing and validating medication, nutrition, and TPN (Total Parenteral Nutrition) in pediatric and neonatal intensive care units.

2. Scope

This plan applies to all activities related to the design, development, verification, validation, deployment, and post-market surveillance of GenPRES. The scope includes hardware/software interfaces, integrations with hospital systems (e.g., HIX), and all user interactions with the GenPRES UI.

3. Risk Management Objectives
	•	Ensure compliance with ISO 14971:2019
	•	Identify and mitigate risks related to patient safety, data integrity, and clinical outcomes
	•	Maintain an acceptable level of residual risk throughout the lifecycle
	•	Provide evidence of a systematic risk management process

4. Risk Acceptability Criteria

Risks are classified according to their severity and probability of occurrence. Risk levels are evaluated against the following thresholds:
	•	Acceptable: No action needed beyond routine monitoring
	•	Tolerable: Risk mitigation is required and must be documented
	•	Unacceptable: Must be eliminated or reduced to acceptable levels

5. Roles and Responsibilities
	•	Risk Manager: Leads the risk management activities, maintains documentation
	•	Clinical Advisor: Evaluates clinical relevance of identified risks
	•	Software Development Team: Implements risk control measures
	•	Quality Assurance: Ensures compliance and verification of controls
	•	Post-Market Surveillance Lead: Monitors incidents and feedback after deployment

6. Risk Management Process
	1.	Hazard Identification
	•	Use literature, clinical experience, incident databases, and user feedback
	2.	Risk Analysis
	•	Determine severity and probability for each hazard
	3.	Risk Evaluation
	•	Compare each risk to acceptability thresholds
	4.	Risk Control
	•	Prioritize: Inherent safety > Protective measures > Information for safety
	•	Implement and verify controls
	5.	Residual Risk Evaluation
	•	Confirm that overall residual risk is acceptable
	6.	Review and Monitoring
	•	Reassess risks at each lifecycle phase and after incidents or updates

7. Risk Control Measures Examples
	•	Automated dosage validation based on patient parameters
	•	Alert system for drug interactions and constraint violations
	•	Logging and audit trails for traceability
	•	UI safeguards (e.g., confirmation dialogs for high-risk actions)

8. Documentation

The following documents are maintained as part of the risk management file:
	•	Risk Management Plan
	•	Hazard Analysis and Risk Assessment
	•	Risk Control Implementation and Verification Records
	•	Residual Risk Evaluation Summary
	•	Risk Management Report

9. Post-Market Surveillance

All adverse events, near misses, and user feedback will be reviewed quarterly. Results will be used to update the risk file and guide design improvements. Metrics such as incident frequency and risk recurrence will be tracked and analyzed.

10. Approval

This plan is reviewed and approved by the responsible authorities within the GenPRES project and the clinical governance board.
